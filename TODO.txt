Things to REMEMBER, THINK about, or to DO
- Maybe add an internal dictionary to NotifyingCollection for faster containment checks. Also being able to temporarily suspend event firing might be useful (AddRange() ??).

- Color properties for headers and color evaluators for columns
- Better/fixed designer support.
