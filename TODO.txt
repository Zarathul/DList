Things to REMEMBER, THINK about, or to DO
- Maybe the grid should not overlap cells ?
- Maybe cache brushes and pens?

- Consolidate the code in ProgressBarCellRenderer for horizontal and vertical bars. Both codepaths are almost identical.
- IntegralHeight mode
- All kinds of events: Header click, item click etc.
- Cell editing.
- Better/fixed designer support.
- Autosize column on grip doubleclick
