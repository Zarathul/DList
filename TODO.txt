Things to REMEMBER, THINK about, or to DO
- Maybe the grid should not overlap cells ?
- Maybe cache brushes and pens?
- Maybe add an internal dictionary to NotifyingCollection for faster containment checks. Also being able to temporarily suspend event firing might be useful (AddRange() ??).

- Finish and improve cell editing.
- All kinds of events: Header click, item click etc.
- Better/fixed designer support.
- Autosize column on grip doubleclick
